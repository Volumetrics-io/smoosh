    <h2>Down the Rabbit-Hole</h2>

    <p>Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister
      on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had
      peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no
      pictures or conversations in it, `and what is the use of a book,'
      thought Alice `without pictures or conversation?'</p>

    <p>So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could,
      for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether
      the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble
      of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White
      Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.</p>

    <p>There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice
      think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to
      itself, `Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought
      it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have
      wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);
      but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-
      POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to
      her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never
      before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to
      take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the
      field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop
      down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.</p>

    <p>In another moment down went Alice after it, never once
      considering how in the world she was to get out again.</p>
