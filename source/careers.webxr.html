                    <p>Let's get the technical stuff out of the way. We obviously need you to be a great engineer!</p>
                    <p>We need somebody who has:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Experience in: Javascript, WebGL, GLSL, OpenGL, and THREE.js</li>
                        <li>Game development or adjacent 3D software experience</li>
                        <li>WebGPU knowledge a plus</li>
                        <li>XR development experience a plus</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>We are not going to count how many months or years you spent building for each technologies, but we will give you exercises to verify your approach and your code quality.</p>

                    <h2>The important, non-technical stuff</h2>
                    <p>There are lots of non-technical things we also expect you to be great at:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>As the third person on the team, you will contribute significantly in building the culture of the company. How you react to feedback, how you give kudos to people, or how you voice a disagreement will have vital
                            importance
                            in defining our culture.</li>

                        <li>We value curiosity. Mixed reality is a space that still has so much to explore. Nobody knows how people will interact with mixed reality in 10 years. Let’s figure it out together.</li>

                        <li>We value transparency. We build in public, and we’re not shy about showing the bad first sketch. We would like you to embrace the spirit of building in public too. </li>
